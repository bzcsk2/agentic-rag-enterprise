"""Persistent run checkpoint for the iteration loop (E-023 contract).

A :class:`RunCheckpoint` captures the resumable state of a
``ChatService.answer_with_iteration`` loop so a mid-loop crash/restart can be
continued by ``ChatService.resume_run``. The checkpoint is persisted as JSON in
the Metadata DB's ``run_checkpoints`` table (the control-plane source of truth).

The re-authorization helper :func:`reauthorize_evidence` is the security-critical
core: on resume it re-checks each gathered :class:`Evidence` against CURRENT
metadata (active document, active version, current ACL, corpus discoverability) and
drops anything the principal can no longer read (build plan §3623 — "ACL 收紧不因旧
Cache/Checkpoint 泄露").
