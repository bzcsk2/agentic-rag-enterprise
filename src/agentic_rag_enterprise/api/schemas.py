"""E-014 API schemas (build plan §6: ``api/`` adapter only, no business rules).

The request body carries ONLY the user's question and the target corpus. All
identity / authorization / policy fields are **runtime-injected from trusted
request metadata** (HTTP headers set by the gateway / IAM), never supplied by
the client body (build plan §5.4). A client must never be able to assert
``tenant_id``, ``is_admin``, ``permissions`` etc. — doing so would void the
API-layer authorization.
