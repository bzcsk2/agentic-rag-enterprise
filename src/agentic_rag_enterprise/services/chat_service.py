"""E-014 shared chat application service (build plan §2.2 / §5 / §6).

One reusable service that backs BOTH the synchronous ``POST /v1/chat`` FastAPI
endpoint and the minimal Gradio adapter. It wires the already-built layers:

* **E-012** ``run_fast_path`` — the one-pass sufficient / insufficient decision
  (exactly one ``retrieve_evidence`` call on the single-pass path);
* **E-011** ``Evidence`` snapshots — the immutable grounding + citation source;
* **E-013** ``build_answer_envelope`` / ``conservative_refusal`` — the typed,
  validated, fail-closed answer envelope;
* **E-019/E-020** ``answer_with_iteration`` — the bounded, gap-driven quality
  iteration loop: it re-judges Required-Fact coverage with a pluggable ``Judge``,
  runs ``GapPlanner`` + ``StopPolicy`` to decide the next retrieval, and only
  then synthesizes (single-corpus; ``answer`` stays the one-pass E-014 path).

The LLM is invoked ONLY here, and only to (a) extract atomic ``Claim``s each
bound to a real ``evidence_id`` and (b) produce a draft prose. Per E-013 the
draft is advisory: the final answer is always derived from the *verified* claims.
Security-context fields (tenant / user / policy / …) are NEVER sent to, or read
back from, the model — they are strictly runtime-injected (build plan §5.4).

        When ``judge`` is ``None`` this degrades to the single-pass E-014 path
        (``_run_single_pass``) so ``answer`` stays green. When a ``judge`` is
        supplied, the service runs the deterministic loop:

        1. round 0 = ``run_fast_path``; if ``insufficient`` → abstain.
        2. Stage A: ``judge.judge(query, required_facts, evidence)``.
        3. ``StopPolicy`` decides whether to stop (``sufficient`` / ``max_rounds``
           / ``no_new_evidence`` / budget / judge fault) or to run another round.
        4. another round → ``GapPlanner`` sub-queries → ``retrieve_evidence``
           (accumulating Evidence) → re-judge.
        5. after the loop → Stage B ``DeterministicClaimEvidenceVerifier`` then
           ``build_answer_envelope`` with the final ``coverage`` attached.

        A retrieval/infra fault propagates as ``FastPathBackendError``; a judge
        fault (``JudgeTimeoutError`` / ``JudgeError``) degrades conservatively to
        an abstain — it is never relabelled as a grounded answer.
