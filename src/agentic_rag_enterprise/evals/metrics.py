"""E-020 eval metrics (build plan §14 / M3).

Metric functions take a produced :class:`AnswerEnvelope` (and, where relevant,
gold labels) and return an :class:`EvalResult` with a ``score`` in ``[0, 1]``
(1.0 = good) plus machine-readable ``details``. These are the offline guards that
catch the two failure modes the M3 iteration loop is specifically meant to
prevent: falsely reporting ``complete`` when a required fact is uncovered, and
presenting a confident fabricated answer when the judge itself fails.

    This is the M3 exit-gate guard that catches the failure mode §14.2 forbids
    ("partial information must not be marked fully supported"): a ``complete``
    answer when the gold/standard answer expects a required fact to be uncovered.

    Two complementary checks (build plan §14 / M3 acceptance P1-5). They are
    *independent* — neither is gated on the presence of the other:

    1. **Real judge-error detection (primary).** If the envelope reports
       ``completeness == "complete"`` but ``gold_missing_fact_ids`` is non-empty,
       the answer is a False Sufficient *regardless* of whether ``coverage`` is
       attached and regardless of what the system's own coverage says. This is
       the principal rule and must fire even for envelopes that carry no
       ``coverage`` (e.g. the M2 baseline), because gold is the source of truth.
    2. **Independent coverage cross-check.** When a ``coverage`` IS attached, the
       envelope is flagged directly if that coverage reports any ``missing`` /
       ``contradicted`` facts of its own (i.e. the answer is ``complete`` while the
       Coverage Judge's own verdict disagrees). This branch is reached only for
       ``complete`` answers with an *empty* ``gold_missing_fact_ids`` (the primary
       guard already handled the gold-missing case above), so it must NOT intersect
       with the gold set — doing so would reduce this branch to dead code. It is a
       separate, self-consistency guard that can fire on its own.

    A non-``complete`` answer (partial / insufficient / conflicted) is never a
    False Sufficient, so it scores 1.0.
