"""Idempotent ingestion Job and active-version protocol (build plan §10).

The job wraps the E-007 ported ingestion chain — ``ParentChildChunker`` →
``ParentStore`` → Qdrant ``VectorStore`` — and adds the control-plane required
by §10.4 (idempotency), §10.5 (compensation) and §10.10 (cross-store
consistency). Metadata DB (``MetadataStore``) is the single source of truth for
lifecycle and active version; Qdrant / Parent Store / filesystem are rebuildable
data planes.

Steps are reentrant and recorded as step markers so a crashed/interrupted job
can resume without producing duplicate business IDs or Chunks (§10.10 #3).
