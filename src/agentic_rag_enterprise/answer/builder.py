"""E-013 AnswerEnvelope builder (build plan §7.9 / §16 / §14.7).

Wraps a caller-supplied grounded answer (``answer_markdown`` + ``claims``) into
a typed, validated :class:`AnswerEnvelope`, rendering immutable citations from
the E-011 Evidence Snapshots and running the single deterministic key-claim
support check. When the E-012 Fast Path says ``insufficient`` it produces a
conservative refusal envelope with no fabricated facts.

Safety invariants enforced here (fail-closed):
* the ``SecurityContext`` tenant must match the ``FastPathResult`` tenant and
  the tenant/corpus of every cited Evidence (no cross-tenant leakage);
* unsupported claims never reach the final answer — when claims are supplied the
  answer text is rendered from the *kept* (supported) claims, so an unsupported
  claim's fact cannot appear in the answer;
* ``conservative_refusal`` only accepts an ``insufficient`` result.
