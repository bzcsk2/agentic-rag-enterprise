"""E-019 deterministic, heuristic Coverage Judge (Stage A, build plan §14.1–§14.3).

This is the Internal-MVP judge: **no LLM, no network**. It decides whether the
retrieved Evidence covers each Required Fact by lexical token overlap, with a
light contradiction heuristic. The verdict follows the fixed fact-status priority
(§14.3). It implements the :class:`~agentic_rag_enterprise.judge.protocol.Judge`
protocol, so a calibrated LLM judge can replace it later without touching the
service or the answer layer.

The judge must NOT use model/common-sense to fill gaps (§14.2): support is
determined only by the Evidence text actually supplied.
