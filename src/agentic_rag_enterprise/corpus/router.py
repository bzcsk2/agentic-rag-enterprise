"""E-016 permission-aware soft router (build plan §9.3 / Milestone 4).

The router is the *only* component that decides which corpora a query should hit.
It is deliberately deterministic and model-free: it consumes **only** the
discoverable, capability-eligible corpora returned by
``CorpusRegistry.resolve_candidates`` and ranks them with a *query-sensitive*
relevance signal combined with the registry-declared ``authority_level``. The
model is never given the full corpus map, and a non-discoverable corpus can never
enter the ranked output.

Scoring (build plan §9.3, all deterministic — no model, no query leakage):

* ``relevance`` = normalized-term overlap between the query and the corpus'
  ``name`` / ``description`` / ``domain`` / ``corpus_id`` / ``capability_ids``
  term bag, in ``[0, 1]``;
* ``authority`` = ``authority_level / 100`` in ``[0, 1]``;
* ``score`` = ``_RELEVANCE_WEIGHT * relevance + _AUTHORITY_WEIGHT * authority``,
  clamped to ``[0, 1]`` (matches ``CorpusCandidate.score`` field ``ge=0, le=1``).

Route policy (build plan §9.3):

* ``high`` confidence  → Top-1 (fallback expansion to Top-2 is signalled to the
  caller via the extra ranked candidate, but the primary is a single corpus);
* ``medium`` confidence → Top-2;
* ``low`` confidence   → Top-3 + ``fallback_search=True`` (the query matched no
  corpus term, so we broaden and probe instead of hard-routing to authority).

``fallback_search`` is ``True`` only for the ``low`` branch (§9.3: "禁止硬路由后
立即把未命中解释为无答案").
