"""E-016 cross-corpus retrieval, merge & dedup (build plan §9.5 / Milestone 4).

Runs the *existing* single-corpus ``SecureRetriever.retrieve_evidence`` once per
selected corpus, passing the same ``SecurityContext`` so every per-corpus
tenant / ACL / active-version / parent-second-auth constraint still applies. The
results are merged into one deterministic, deduplicated Evidence set.

Fault handling (fail-loud, never fail-silent, and never *fail-open*):

* Only *explicit backend / infrastructure* faults are captured as a
  :class:`CorpusRetrievalFault`; the other corpora's evidence is still returned.
  A backend fault is never relabelled as "no Evidence".
* **Security, tenant-binding, corpus-binding, authorization and configuration
  errors propagate immediately** (fail closed). They are never downgraded to a
  partial retrieval fault even when another corpus returns evidence — a denial or
  a binding violation must never be masked by a successful sibling corpus.
* ``retrieve`` raises only when *every* selected corpus faults (a total outage is
  an error, not an abstain). A partial fault is surfaced in ``faults`` for the
  caller to degrade with an explicit limitation.
* Every returned Evidence is re-bound to the requested tenant and the corpus it
  was requested from; a snapshot that claims a different tenant/corpus is a
  security violation and raises (never a fault, never merged).
