# Issue E-024 — Health/readiness, persistent cancellation, backup/restore + runbooks

**Milestone:** M7 — Runtime hardening (`E-022` → `E-024`)
**Status:** contract open — implementation pending. This is the **remediation** of the
first submission (`ea3c724`), which was returned FAIL on six blocking (P1) design gaps.
All six P1 findings (P1-1 storage topology, P1-2 round-0 cancellation, P1-3 CAS method,
P1-4 cancel API shape, P1-5 health route migration, P1-6 readiness collection scope)
are closed below. Acceptance of this doc unlocks, in order, the readiness/liveness
probe (reusing the existing `/health` + new `/ready`), the persistent cancellation
surface (built on the E-023 `run_checkpoints` state machine, with a new CAS method in
`storage/metadata_store.py`), the backup/restore tooling (multi-file SQLite snapshot
covering BOTH the Metadata DB and the Evidence Snapshot Store + restore-through-
reconciler), and the operations runbooks under `docs/runbooks/`.
**Baseline:** `1bc627f` (main HEAD; E-023 CLOSED / ACCEPTED at `a1cd282`; M7 current).
**Build plan refs:** Milestone 7 (§3619 / §3621 / §3623 — exit gate: "依赖故障降级和恢复
测试通过；冻结 release reference profile"), §4214 (FastAPI runtime hardening list —
"持久 Checkpoint / Health / readiness / Cancel / Backend failure degradation"), §5081
(M7 / E-024 scope), §23.7 (quality-gate commands), §29.5 (`depends_on` / `in_scope` /
`deferred_to` rules).
**Depends on:** E-008 / E-008.x (MetadataStore = control-plane source of truth +
`document_builds` lease pattern), E-011 (Evidence Snapshot Store — `evidence.db`,
immutable evidence snapshots + `evidence_audit_log`, reference replay + read-time
re-auth audit), E-022 (Reconciler + index rollback — the rebuild tool E-024 restore
leans on), E-023 (`run_checkpoints` state machine = the ONLY cancellation truth source).
Reuses `storage/metadata_store.py`, `storage/evidence_store.py` (`EvidenceSnapshotStore`),
`storage/checkpoint_store.py` (`RunCheckpoint`, `CHECKPOINT_RUNNING`/`COMPLETED`/`ABORTED`),
`services/chat_service.py` (`resume_run`, the iteration loop), `corpus/registry.py`,
`ingestion/reconciler.py`. **No new storage engine is introduced** — local SQLite +
in-process/local Qdrant only (Postgres / Qdrant Server are M9).

### Frozen storage topology (P1-1)

The Internal MVP has **TWO** SQLite control-plane stores, both on the local filesystem
(verified against `src/.../storage/evidence_store.py:101` and
`src/.../services/container.py`):

* **Metadata DB** (`metadata.db` by default, `settings.metadata_db_path`) — documents,
  ACLs, corpus registry, active-version pointers, ingestion leases, checkpoint table,
  reconciler findings.
* **Evidence Snapshot Store** (`evidence.db` by default, `EvidenceSnapshotStore`) —
  immutable `evidence_snapshots` rows + `evidence_audit_log` (`audit:evidence:read`
  events). This is the E-011 reference-replay + audit source of truth; it is a
  SEPARATE file from the Metadata DB and is NOT wired into `DefaultServiceContainer`
  today.

The Qdrant collection(s) and the Parent Store remain **rebuildable data planes** (the
Reconciler / re-ingest reconstruct them from the Metadata DB). The Evidence Snapshot
Store, however, is NOT rebuildable from the Metadata DB (it carries historical body +
audit events), so it is a **backup source of truth**, not a rebuildable plane.

Therefore the backup scope MUST cover both DB files (see §1-C). A single-file
`metadata.db`-only backup is explicitly **rejected** by this contract.

## 1. Scope and non-goals

### In scope (runtime hardening of the serving / operations planes)

- **A. Health & Readiness** (`api/routes/health.py`):
  - `GET /health` (liveness): answers only "is the process alive?" — does NOT depend on
    Qdrant / Metadata DB / model availability, so a transient dependency fault never
    kills liveness.
  - `GET /ready` (readiness): answers "can this instance safely take prod traffic?"
    Checks (each with a strict timeout; ANY failure → **503** with a fixed, generic body,
    see the frozen readiness rule in §1-E): applied migrations, Metadata DB reachable,
    Evidence Snapshot Store reachable, Corpus Registry loadable, every corpus in the
    release reference profile resolved to a live collection, required local dependencies
    present.
  - readiness **never** calls the LLM and **never** performs a business-side repair;
    the `Reconciler` is the repair tool, readiness is a diagnostic gate only.
  - Strict per-check timeouts; a dependency exception → 503; the client sees only
    controlled status — never a path, SQL text, corpus name, or exception body.
- **B. Persistent Cancellation** (built on E-023 `run_checkpoints`):
  - `running → aborted` via a new `cancel_run(run_id, ctx)` service method reached by a
    dedicated `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/cancel` endpoint (see §2 "Cancellation API").
    NO in-memory-only cancellation token is ever the source of truth.
  - Re-validates `tenant_id` / `user_id` / `session_id` binding before cancelling;
    foreign principal → fail closed (refused, indistinguishable from "not found").
  - Uses a new atomic CAS method `cancel_run_checkpoint(...)` in
    `storage/metadata_store.py` so `complete` and `cancel` cannot race into an illegal
    state (P1-3). Idempotent: cancelling an already-`aborted` run returns `already_aborted`.
  - **Round-0 cancellation (P1-2):** the loop MUST create a minimal `running` checkpoint
    *before* the round-0 `run_fast_path` retrieval, so a `run_id` submitted by the
    client is cancellable even while the first retrieval is blocking. The pre-round-0
    checkpoint uses `first_result=None`, `round_index=0`, empty evidence, and the
    immutable identity binding; if the run is cancelled before round 0 retrieves, the
    `cancel_run_checkpoint` CAS flips it to `aborted` and the cooperative check (below)
    finalizes a conservative refusal with zero retrieval/judge/model calls. If the run
    completes naturally, the existing per-round `_save_checkpoint` overwrites this
    minimal row with the full state (same identity binding → UPDATE, not conflict).
  - Cooperative cancellation: at deterministic boundaries (before EACH retrieval — this
    now includes the round-0 `run_fast_path` via the pre-round-0 checkpoint check — and
    before judge / synthesis per round) the loop checks the persisted `aborted` status
    and stops. An already-entered synchronous call is allowed to finish (no hard
    preemption); no NEW Retriever / Judge / Model call is issued after cancel is observed.
  - `aborted` survives restart (it is a persisted row status) and `aborted` checkpoints
    are NOT resumable (E-023 already refuses `aborted` in `resume_run`).
  - **Pre-round-0 recovery state machine (R2-P1-1, FROZEN):** `resume_run` MUST branch on
    the persisted `status` **FIRST**, and only NARROW `first_result` requirements for
    states that need finalization. The pre-round-0 checkpoint (`first_result=None`,
    `round_index=0`, empty evidence) introduces three additional (status × first_result)
    combinations. The complete, exhaustive table:
    - `aborted` + `first_result=None` → refuse **by status first** with
      `ResumeAuthError("checkpoint_aborted")` (NEVER an `AssertionError`); the
      `first_result` being `None` is irrelevant once status is `aborted`.
    - `running` + `first_result=None` → after the standard identity / `policy_version` /
      corpus-discoverability re-auth, **restart from round 0** (re-run `run_fast_path`,
      then continue the normal loop). This is the "crashed before round-0 retrieval"
      recovery. No `AssertionError` is allowed.
    - `completed` + `first_result=None` → **corrupt / illegal state** (a completed run must
      always have a `first_result`). Fail closed: `ResumeAuthError` (or treat as broken,
      like `load_run_checkpoint`'s corruption guard) — do NOT enter Retriever / Judge /
      Model.
    - `aborted` + `first_result` set → refuse with `ResumeAuthError("checkpoint_aborted")`
      (unchanged E-023 behavior).
    - `running` + `first_result` set → normal resume from `round_index` (E-023 behavior).
    - `completed` + `first_result` set → idempotent finalize (E-023 behavior).
    The acceptance matrix MUST cover the first three (pre-round-0) combinations with
    explicit tests, asserting `resume_run` raises `ResumeAuthError` (aborted/completed) or
    re-runs round 0 (running) WITHOUT ever hitting an `AssertionError`.
- **C. Backup / Restore** (local MVP, no cloud / no Postgres / no Qdrant Server):
  - **Backup sources of truth = BOTH control-plane SQLite files** (P1-1): the Metadata
    DB (`metadata.db`) AND the Evidence Snapshot Store (`evidence.db`). Qdrant collection(s)
    and the Parent Store remain **rebuildable data planes** (the Reconciler / re-ingest
    reconstruct them from the Metadata DB); they are NOT part of the backup artifact.
  - Backup = consistent SQLite snapshot of EACH control-plane file (SQLite backup API or
    equivalent) taken while honoring active writers; never a raw `cp` of a live, open
    DB file.
  - **Cross-file consistency barrier (R2-P1-4, FROZEN):** the two control-plane DBs are
    snapshotted under a single coordinated barrier so the backup reflects one logical
    epoch, NOT two independently-timed consistent files. The `BackupCoordinator`:
    1. acquires a global write barrier on BOTH `MetadataStore` and `EvidenceSnapshotStore`
       (e.g. a briefly-held exclusive lock / `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on each, or an explicit
       offline/quiesced backup for the Internal MVP — the contract permits the quiesced
       mode);
    2. records a single `snapshot_epoch` (monotonic timestamp/seq) shared by both files;
    3. performs the SQLite backup of each file;
    4. computes per-file sha256 and writes the manifest;
    5. releases the barrier.
    Under concurrent retrieval/audit writes, the barrier guarantees metadata.db and
    evidence.db are at the same `snapshot_epoch` (not metadata@T2 + evidence@T1).
  - **Evidence schema version (R2-P1-4):** the Evidence Snapshot Store currently creates
    its schema with inline `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and has no `schema_migrations`
    table. The contract freezes ONE of the following (implementer picks, all acceptable):
    - a module-level `EVIDENCE_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant written into the manifest, OR
    - an `evidence_schema_version` table the store maintains, OR
    - a structural fingerprint (sorted `CREATE TABLE` DDL hash) recorded in the manifest.
    The manifest's per-file entry for the Evidence DB MUST carry this version/fingerprint
    (not a "migration list" that does not exist). `storage/evidence_store.py` is added to
    the allowed-paths list so it can expose a safe backup lock, its schema version, and a
    backup primitive.
  - Backup artifact carries a **versioned manifest** (format version, `snapshot_epoch`,
    per-file {path, sha256, schema_version_or_fingerprint, timestamp}, corpus/collection
    pointers). The manifest lists exactly the files captured so restore can verify each one.
  - **Restore**: verify manifest/checksum/format/compatibility for EVERY listed file
    FIRST; on failure, leave the current runnable DBs untouched. Before replacing, take
    a pre-restore backup of each target file (or require an explicit offline atomic swap).
    After restore: apply migrations, restore registry pointer, run the `Reconciler` to
    rebuild/reconcile the Qdrant + Parent Store data planes, then verify readiness.
  - Backup / restore logs MUST NOT print Evidence bodies, ACL member lists, or sensitive
    paths. Local backup is explicitly **unencrypted** (no approved encryption dependency).
- **D. Runbooks + Release Reference Profile** (`docs/operations.md`,
  `docs/runbooks/*.md`): readiness-failure, cancel-stuck-run, backup, restore,
  reconcile, index-rollback. Each runbook gives preconditions, dry-run/check command,
  execution steps, success signal, failure rollback, sensitivity notes, and the
  local-MVP-vs-M9 boundary.

### Deferred to sibling / later issues (do NOT pre-build)

- **E-025 → E-027** — formal evaluation / red-team / Research MVP release gate. E-024
  does NOT add evaluation harness logic, Golden Set, or CI gating beyond what the
  runbooks describe.
- **M9** — real Postgres, Qdrant Server, SSO, external connectors, online monitoring,
  canary, distributed/cross-node cancellation. E-024 stays on local SQLite +
  in-process/local Qdrant; cancellation is single-instance and persistent, not
  cross-node.
- Distributed task scheduler, cross-node resume, online backup service, cloud object
  storage, Kubernetes deployment manifests — all out of scope.

### Forbidden / non-goals

- **No LLM / NLP in readiness or backup/restore.** Both are deterministic and hermetic.
- **No new model download / external API in tests** — use the existing `fake` encoders,
  `FakeModel`/`_DevSynthesisModel`, and local Qdrant; tests must be fully hermetic.
- **No "reserved interface" for E-025–E-027 or M9** — do not add unused services,
  tables, flags, or runtime branches "for later". Minimal type boundaries only, and
  only if exercised by a current test.
- **No change to the Planner core** (`planner/`, `executor.py`, `result.py`,
  `budget.py`, `tool_registry.py`) — frozen and out of scope.
- **Cancellation truth = persisted `run_checkpoints` only.** A pure in-memory
  cancellation token must never be the authority (build plan §3623 / E-023 invariant 5).
- **Readiness must never perform a business-side repair or call the LLM** — it is a
  diagnostic gate; the `Reconciler` repairs.
- **Backup/restore must never resurrect deleted/purged evidence** and must fail closed:
  a corrupt/tampered/unsupported backup is rejected, never partially applied.

### Hard invariants (frozen)

1. **Metadata DB is the source of truth** for both checkpoints (E-023) and cancellation.
   An `aborted` decision is persisted, never merely held in memory.
2. **Fail closed on auth.** Foreign-principal / stale-policy / non-discoverable-corpus
   cancellation is refused and is indistinguishable from "run not found" to the client.
3. **Complete/cancel are race-safe.** A DB transaction or CAS prevents a run from being
   marked both `completed` and `aborted`; the persisted state is always a legal
   terminal/running value.
4. **Cooperative, not pre-emptive.** After `cancel` is observed, no NEW Retriever/Judge/
   Model call is issued, but an in-flight synchronous call may finish (no hard kill);
   restart still honors `aborted`.
5. **Readiness never leaks.** The client sees only a status code + fixed generic body;
   no path / SQL / corpus name / exception text / tenant id / evidence id.
6. **Readiness never repairs.** It diagnoses; the `Reconciler` repairs. Readiness never
   calls the LLM.
7. **Backup consistency.** A backup is a consistent snapshot (never a mid-write `cp`);
   its manifest + checksum are verifiable; restore rejects a tampered/unsupported
   artifact and leaves the live DB untouched on failure.
8. **Rebuildable data planes.** Qdrant / Parent Store are reconstructed from the
   Metadata DB (ingest / reconciler) after restore — backup/restore never depends on
   copying vector data.

## 2. API contracts

### Readiness / liveness
- `GET /health` → `200 {"status":"ok"}` (process alive; no dependency checks). This
  REUSES the existing route currently registered in `api/main.py` (P1-5); it is migrated
  into `api/routes/health.py` and the legacy inline definition in `main.py` is removed
  (no duplicate `/health` registration; the existing `tests/...` legacy `/health`
  characterization test must still pass).
- `GET /ready` → `200 {"status":"ready"}` when all checks pass; `503 {"status":"unavailable"}`
  on ANY check failure. Body is fixed + generic; the HTTP status is the only signal.
  Registered via the same `api/routes/health.py` module (so a single router owns the
  health surface and double-registration is impossible).
- **Frozen readiness rule (R2-P1-5 — single, non-contradictory):** there is exactly
  ONE readiness decision, stated here and nowhere else in this contract. Delete any
  other phrasing ("at least one active collection", "registry must be non-empty",
  "whose pointer is set").
  1. Corpus Registry read FAILS (exception) → **503**.
  2. Corpus Registry read SUCCEEDS and the **release reference profile is empty** (no
     `enabled`+`searchable` corpus required) → **ready** (200). This is the only path by
     which an "empty" instance is `ready`; it is driven by the profile being empty, NOT
     by "registry empty" or "zero collections".
  3. For **EACH** corpus in the release reference profile (the set of `enabled`+
     `searchable` corpora that MUST be live for this instance; for the Internal MVP that
     set = all currently registered `enabled`+`searchable` corpora), BOTH must hold or
     the instance is **unavailable** (503):
     - the corpus's `active_collection` pointer is NON-EMPTY (a missing pointer is itself
       a failure, not a skip); AND
     - the pointer resolves to an **actually-existing** Qdrant collection.
- Check order (each wrapped in a timeout, any exception → 503):
  1. migrations applied (`schema_migrations` has the expected max version) on the
     Metadata DB;
  2. Metadata DB reachable (a trivial read inside the timeout);
  3. Evidence Snapshot Store reachable (a trivial read on `evidence.db`) — it is a
     backup source of truth and must be intact for replay/audit (P1-1);
  4. Corpus Registry loadable (read success/failure per rule step 1 above);
  5. every corpus in the release reference profile has a non-empty `active_collection`
     pointer resolving to an existing Qdrant collection (rule step 3);
  6. required local dependencies (encoders/model) importable.

### Cancellation API (P1-4 — FROZEN, not optional)
- **Dedicated endpoint:** `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/cancel`. Request body is EMPTY;
  identity is injected from trusted headers (same gateway injection as `/v1/chat`),
  never the body. `run_id` is a path parameter, so no meaningless `query`/`corpus_id`
  is forced onto a cancel request (this also avoids schema-confused cancel/resume/chat
  state combinations on `POST /v1/chat`).
- The route calls `service.cancel_run(run_id, ctx)`, which delegates to the atomic
  `metadata_store.cancel_run_checkpoint(run_id, tenant_id, user_id, session_id,
  policy_version)`.
- **State table (frozen):**
  - `running` + cancel → `aborted` (200).
  - `aborted` + cancel → `aborted` (200, idempotent).
  - `completed` + cancel → `completed` (200; cancellation of an already-finished run is a
    no-op and is NOT an error — fixed to 200, not 409, to keep the client contract simple
    and idempotent).
  - missing / foreign-principal / stale-`policy_version` / undiscoverable-corpus → **same
    generic 404** (reason never leaks).
- The iteration loop consults `metadata_store.load_run_checkpoint(run_id).status`
  (cooperative boundary) before each retrieval (including the round-0 `run_fast_path` via
  the pre-round-0 checkpoint, P1-2) / judge / synthesis step and raises a typed
  `_CancelRequested` control flow that finalizes a conservative refusal WITHOUT calling
  the model.

### Backup / restore (CLI, not HTTP)
- Unified command: `python -m agentic_rag_enterprise.operations.backup
  {backup|restore}` (subcommand form; `operations/__init__.py` + `operations/backup.py`
  + `operations/restore.py` are the landing zones). Both subcommands read DB paths from
  `settings.metadata_db_path` / `settings.evidence_db_path` unless overridden by flags.
- `... backup --out <dir>` → the `BackupCoordinator` acquires the cross-file write
  barrier, records `snapshot_epoch`, snapshots BOTH control-plane DBs
  (`<dir>/metadata-<ts>.db`, `<dir>/evidence-<ts>.db`), computes per-file sha256 + the
  Evidence schema version/fingerprint, and writes `<dir>/manifest.json` (format version,
  `snapshot_epoch`, per-file {path, sha256, schema_version_or_fingerprint, timestamp},
  corpus/collection pointers). Then releases the barrier.
- `... restore --in <dir> --metadata-db <target> --evidence-db <target-evidence>` →
  verifies manifest/checksum/`snapshot_epoch`/format for EVERY listed file (incl. the
  Evidence schema version/fingerprint); refuses on any mismatch; takes a pre-restore
  backup of each target; swaps atomically (or requires offline swap); applies migrations;
  runs the `Reconciler`; verifies readiness. On any verification failure, leaves the live
  DBs untouched.

---

## 3. Failure semantics

- readiness dependency fault / missing migration / missing collection → **503**, generic
  body only.
- cancel by foreign principal / missing run → **4xx**, generic body; reason never leaks.
- cancel idempotent: re-cancel of `aborted` / `completed` returns the same safe result.
- cancel race with complete: CAS/transaction ensures exactly one terminal status wins;
  the loser is a no-op or a safe conflict (never an illegal dual status).
- backup corruption / checksum mismatch / unsupported format → restore refuses, current
  DB preserved, error logged internally (no sensitive detail to client/console beyond
  "backup rejected").
- No dependency fault may be relabelled as a no-evidence answer or a refused run (build
  plan §5.4). A readiness/cancel failure is an operational signal, not a grounding
  outcome.

---

## 4. Migration / rollback strategy

- **No new Metadata DB migration required** for E-024: it reuses the E-023
  `run_checkpoints` `status` column (`aborted` already exists and `resume_run` already
  refuses it). **Both** terminal transitions become transactional CAS methods on
  `metadata_store.py`, each inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (R2-P1-3 — the race
  is bidirectional; freezing only the cancel side is insufficient):
  - `cancel_run_checkpoint(run_id, tenant_id, user_id, session_id, policy_version)`:
    - reads the row's current `status` + identity binding;
    - identity mismatch → raise `CheckpointIdentityConflict` (fail closed);
    - `completed` → return `already_completed` (no flip, idempotent 200);
    - `aborted` → return `already_aborted` (idempotent 200);
    - `running` → flip to `aborted` via `UPDATE ... SET status='aborted' WHERE run_id=?
      AND status='running'` and return `running_to_aborted`.
  - `complete_run_checkpoint(run_id)` (REPLACES the current unconditional
    `mark_run_checkpoint_done` UPDATE — the old method is removed/renamed so no code path
    can flip `aborted → completed`):
    - `running` → `completed` via `UPDATE ... SET status='completed' WHERE run_id=? AND
      status='running'` (return `running_to_completed`);
    - `completed` → `already_completed`;
    - `aborted` → `already_aborted` (a cancelled run is NOT silently completed);
    - missing → `not_found`.
  Because BOTH use `WHERE status='running'` guards inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, the
  interleaving `cancel → aborted` then stale `complete` is a no-op (the `WHERE` matches
  nothing), and `complete → completed` then stale `cancel` is likewise a no-op. Exactly
  one terminal status survives; never both. **ALL** iteration terminal paths
  (`answer_with_iteration` end-of-loop, `_BreakLoop` handlers, resume terminal paths)
  MUST call `complete_run_checkpoint`, never a raw `UPDATE`.
- Readiness is read-only — no migration. Evidence Snapshot Store uses its own existing
  `apply_migrations` (no new migration needed for backup, since restore re-applies it).
- Backup/restore operates on the existing Metadata DB + Evidence DB files + manifest;
  rollback = restore the pre-restore backup.
- Index rollback remains the E-022 capability; E-024 runbooks *reference* it but do not
  reimplement it.

---

## 5. Acceptance matrix

### Readiness / liveness
- healthy stack → `/ready` 200.
- Metadata DB unavailable → `/ready` 503.
- migration missing / incompatible → `/ready` 503.
- active collection missing → `/ready` 503.
- `/health` returns 200 even when a recoverable dependency is down.
- readiness body never leaks internal identifiers / exception text.

### Cancellation
- same principal can cancel a `running` run → `aborted`.
- **Round-0 cancellation — TWO distinct scenarios (R2-P1-2, MUST be split):**
  - **Scenario A (cancel BEFORE the round-0 pre-call check):** the run is cancelled before
    the loop's cooperative check fires (pre-round-0 checkpoint already `aborted`). On
    resume/continue the loop issues **0 Retriever / 0 Judge / 0 Model** calls and
    finalizes a conservative refusal (`tool_calls=0`).
  - **Scenario B (cancel AFTER the round-0 Retriever is already entered & blocking):** the
    in-flight synchronous Retriever call is allowed to RETURN (cooperative cancellation
    never hard-kills an entered call); its result is **discarded**; the loop then issues
    **0 additional Retriever / 0 Judge / 0 Model** calls and keeps `status=aborted`. The
    returned `AnswerEnvelope.tool_calls` MUST truthfully record the 1 already-executed
    retrieval (NOT 0) — the count reflects reality, not the post-cancel ideal.
  Both scenarios are covered by integration tests (blocking round-0 Retriever + concurrent
  cancel, plus a cancel-before-check variant).
- foreign principal cannot cancel → refused (generic 404, reason hidden).
- **stale `policy_version` or undiscoverable corpus cannot cancel** → same generic 404.
- **cancel of a `completed` run → 200, no-op (status stays `completed`).**
- cancel is idempotent (re-cancel of `aborted` → 200 `already_aborted`).
- complete/cancel race yields a single, legal terminal status (bidirectional CAS under
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, see §4).
- after cancel, **zero NEW** Judge/Model calls (fault service proves it); an already-
  entered round-0 Retriever may return exactly once and is discarded (Scenario B).
- `aborted` state survives restart and is NOT resumable (E-023 `resume_run` refuses).
- `cancel_run_checkpoint` invariant tests: `running_to_aborted` / `already_aborted` /
  `already_completed` / `not_found` / `CheckpointIdentityConflict`.
- **Bidirectional complete/cancel race tests (R2-P1-3):** using the SQL `WHERE
  status='running'` guards under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`:
  - cancel acquires the txn first → `aborted`; a subsequent stale `complete_run_checkpoint`
    is a no-op (status stays `aborted`);
  - complete acquires the txn first → `completed`; a subsequent stale
    `cancel_run_checkpoint` is a no-op (status stays `completed`);
  - cancel commits, then OLD execution flow tries complete → no-op (`already_aborted`);
  - complete commits, then client tries cancel → no-op (`already_completed`).
  In every case the final status is a single legal value, never both `aborted` and
  `completed`.

### Backup / restore
- consistent backup of BOTH the Metadata DB and the Evidence Snapshot Store taken under
  concurrent retrieval/audit writes, coordinated by the `BackupCoordinator` barrier so
  both files share one `snapshot_epoch` (NOT independently-timed consistent files).
- manifest carries per-file sha256 + the Evidence schema version/fingerprint; both
  verifiable.
- tampered backup (any file checksum or schema-version mismatch) is rejected; live DBs
  untouched.
- restore to fresh DBs yields identical documents / ACLs / checkpoints / active collection
  pointer / evidence snapshots / evidence audit log, all at the same `snapshot_epoch`.
- restore failure preserves the old DBs.
- after restore, the `Reconciler` can rebuild a missing Qdrant/Parent-Store data plane.
- readiness passes after restore.

### Runbooks
- `docs/operations.md` + `docs/runbooks/{readiness-failure,cancel-stuck-run,backup,restore,reconcile,index-rollback}.md`
  exist and each contains preconditions / check / steps / success / rollback / sensitivity
  notes / MVP-vs-M9 boundary.

## 7. Files (implementation landing zones, not created until acceptance)

- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/api/routes/health.py` (new) — `/health` (migrated from
  `api/main.py`) + `/ready`. `api/main.py` is edited to REMOVE the inline `/health`
  definition and to `include_router` the health router (no double registration).
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/api/routes/runs.py` (new) — `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/cancel`
  (thin, fail-closed; identity from trusted headers).
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/api/main.py` (edit) — remove inline `/health`; register
  health + runs routers.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/api/dependencies.py` (edit) — provide `get_security_context`
  reuse for the cancel route.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/storage/metadata_store.py` (edit) — add BOTH transactional
  CAS methods under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (R2-P1-3):
  `cancel_run_checkpoint(run_id, tenant_id, user_id, session_id, policy_version)` and
  `complete_run_checkpoint(run_id)` (replaces the unconditional `mark_run_checkpoint_done`
  UPDATE; all iteration terminal paths use it).
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/storage/evidence_store.py` (edit, R2-P1-4) — expose a safe
  backup lock / `EVIDENCE_SCHEMA_VERSION` (or schema-version table / DDL fingerprint) and
  a backup primitive usable by the `BackupCoordinator`.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/services/chat_service.py` (edit) — `cancel_run` +
  `complete_run_checkpoint` delegation; pre-round-0 minimal `running` checkpoint (P1-2);
  `resume_run` FIRST branches on `status` then narrows `first_result` per the R2-P1-1
  table (assert is removed for `first_result=None`); cooperative cancellation check before
  each retrieval (incl. round-0) / judge / synthesis.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/services/container.py` (edit, P2) — add `evidence_db_path`
  param; construct `EvidenceSnapshotStore` from it; pass it to the service / expose it for
  backup; `DefaultServiceContainer(metadata_db_path=None, evidence_db_path=None)` and
  `reset_default_container(metadata_db_path=None, evidence_db_path=None)`.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/config.py` (edit, P2) — add `evidence_db_path: str =
  "evidence.db"`; CLI/backup read both `metadata_db_path` and `evidence_db_path`.
- `.env.example` (edit, P2) — document `EVIDENCE_DB_PATH`.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/operations/__init__.py` (new, P2) — package init for the
  `operations` CLI namespace.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/operations/backup.py` (new) — `BackupCoordinator` (cross-file
  barrier + `snapshot_epoch`) + `backup` subcommand.
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/operations/restore.py` (new, P2) — `restore` subcommand
  (manifest/checksum/schema-version verify, pre-restore backup, reconciler, readiness).
- `src/agentic_rag_enterprise/api/schemas.py` — no `action` field on `ChatRequest` (cancel
  is a dedicated endpoint, P1-4); `ChatRequest` stays `query`+`corpus_id`+`run_id`+`resume`.
- `docs/operations.md`, `docs/runbooks/*.md` (new).
- **Test DB hygiene (P2):** every test must use a PAIR of hermetic temp paths
  (`metadata_db_path`, `evidence_db_path`) so containers never share a root-dir
  `evidence.db`; `reset_default_container` is called with both.
- `tests/unit/test_health_readiness.py` (incl. legacy `/health` regression,
  frozen-readiness-rule cases: registry-read-fail→503 / empty-profile→ready /
  missing-pointer→503 / missing-collection→503), `tests/unit/test_cancellation.py`
  (CAS invariants + bidirectional race + completed/stale-policy/undiscoverable + pre-
  round-0 state-machine A/B scenarios), `tests/unit/test_backup_restore.py`
  (multi-file manifest/checksum/`snapshot_epoch`/evidence-schema-version/tamper + barrier
  under concurrent writes), `tests/integration/test_e024_runtime_hardening.py`
  (incl. blocking round-0 Retriever + concurrent cancel).
